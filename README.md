# Mentorz-OpenAI

The GPT file is utilized to create a Python GPT bot that creates mentorship goals between the mentee and mentor. Utilizing training files in JSON, the GPT 
bot is able to refine goals to be specific to what the mentee needs for his/her goal based on certain criteria such as years of expertise and subject focus. For the live transcription and whisper file, these files allow for transcription of the audio meetings between the mentee and the mentor into text based on the audio file parsed in to be transcripted.

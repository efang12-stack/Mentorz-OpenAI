# Mentorz-OpenAI

The GPT file is utilized to create a Python GPT bot that creates a mentorship goal for the mentee with the mentor. Utilizing training files in JSON, the GPT 
bot is able to refine its goals to be specific to what the mentee needs for his/her goal. For the live transcription and whisper file, these files allow for transcription 
of the audio meetings between the mentee and the mentor.
